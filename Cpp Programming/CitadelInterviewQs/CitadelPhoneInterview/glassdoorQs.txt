These questions are asked by Yan Wang:
1 a) Given a series of coin toss, X where X = 1, -1 represents heads and tails respectively
And given a series of guesses G, where E[G] = 0
If the probability of making the correct guess is p, find Corr(G,X) in terms of p.

1 b) Given another series of guess Ga and Gb such that the corr(Ga,Gb) = 0, E[Ga] = E[Gb] = 0, and probability of making the correct guess is 
pa and pb respectively, find G = f(Ga,Gb) such that corr(G,X) is maximised.

2) Given a sequence of integers from 1 to n, and given a permutation
a[1], .. , a[n], find the total number of permutations such that for any index i in the new array, a[j] < a[i] or a[j] > a[i] for all j < i
