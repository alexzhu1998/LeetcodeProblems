3) What is the data structure of a dictionary in Python?
Ans)
A dictionary maps keys to values. It is definitely most similar to a hash table, but there are often many other ways to perform such a mapping.
For instance: Red black trees can do such a mapping with O(log N) time
RB trees are self balancing trees that have alternating red and black nodes to maintain the property that the longest path from root is no more than
twice the length of the shortest path. Search, Insert, Remove will have O(log N) run time.
A hash table is a data structure that maps keys to values by taking the hash value of the key (applying some hash function to it) and map to a bucket
where one or more values are stored.
