I am quite interested in the flexibilities and freedom in the extent of how quant researchers can develop, testing to production. Would the company put more priority on predictive power of a quant strategy or interpretability? So in other words, what happens if there are strategies that are too difficult to understand but they have proven to work?

How does Citadel Securities measure the performance of a quant researcher? Because the role is different to software engineer/ traders
